discussion between jRaskell, bobgardner, theusch, Koshchi, code by jRaskell. 

Another approach discussed on the same page is to use free running mode on one channel only,
with (eg. 4) two resistor voltage dividers to define each input pseudo-channel.
The drawback there is lower resolution for each input because the 10-bit input 
range has to be divided between them.

analog inputs while generating sound with Mozzi.  For many sketches, however, simply putting setupFastAnalogRead()
in setup() and calling Arduino's usual analogRead() will work fast enough.

More detail: startRead() starts an initial conversion which triggers an interrupt when it's complete.
The interrupt code stores the result in an array, changes to the next channel and
starts another conversion.  When all the channels have been sampled, the ISR doesn't
start a new conversion, so it doesn't re-trigger itself or use processor time until
startRead() is called again.  At any time the latest conversion result for each channel is
available by calling getSensor(channel_num).

/**  @ingroup analog
Prepare an analog input channel by turning off its digital input buffer.
This helps to reduce noise, increase analog reading speed, and save power.

Here's more detail from http://www.openmusiclabs.com/learning/digital/atmega-adc/:

The DIDR (Data Input Disable Register) disconnects the digital inputs from whichever ADC channels you are using.  This is important for 2 reasons. First off, an analog input will be floating all over the place, and causing the digital input to constantly toggle high and low. This creates excessive noise near the ADC, and burns extra power. Secondly, the digital input and associated DIDR switch have a capacitance associated with them which will slow down your input signal if you are sampling a highly resistive load.

And from the ATmega328p datasheet, p266:

When an analog signal is applied to the ADC5..0 pin and the digital input from
this pin is not needed, this bit should be written logic one to reduce power
consumption in the digital input buffer. Note that ADC pins ADC7 and ADC6 do not have digital input buffers, and therefore do not require Digital Input Disable bits.
@param channel_num the analog input channel you wish to use.
*/

Reconnect the digital input buffer for an analog input channel which has
been set for analog input with disconnectDigitalIn().

/** @ingroup analog
Starts an analog-to-digital conversion of the voltage at a specified pin.  Unlike
Arduino's analogRead() function which waits until a conversion is complete before
returning, startAnalogRead() only sets the conversion to begin, so you can use
the cpu for other things and call for the result later with receiveAnalogRead().
This works well in updateControl(), where you can call startAnalogRead() and
get the result with receiveAnalogRead() the next time the updateControl()
interrupt runs.
@param pin is the analog pin number to sample from, A0 to A5
(or whatever your board goes up to).
@note This does not require initADC(), but it is messier to use than the
the initADC(), startRead(), getSensor() way.
@note Timing: about 1us when used in updateControl() with CONTROL_RATE 64.
