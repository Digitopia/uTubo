# uTubo
Monophonic synth using Arduino and Mozzi library

This instrument was developed with an Arduino 2560 and the Mozzi synthesis library for Arduino. All the development was made at Casa da Música, with Digitópia for the project Sonópia - Ao Alcance de Todos, 2013.

The Mozzi library (version 0.01.1s) had minor changes to work with my Arduino Mega 2560 board and is distributed within this project (inside the Arduino folder), and you should install it just like any other Arduino library (somewhere in ~/Documents/Arduino/libraries). 

Full credit of the Mozzi library here distributed remains to Tim Barrass (https://github.com/sensorium/Mozzi), for which I am extremely grateful for sharing his amazing open-source synth library.

Despite this project is already finished and working, more info will be added later. If you have any questions you should contact @p1nh0
